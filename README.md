## Demo
Update the link here
[https://caishworkshop.netlify.app](https://caishworkshop.netlify.app)

### Testing strategy
In order to fully try out the website, you'll need to create an account. You can search for "Test Dummy" to test out sending messages in a conversation, but if you would like to see what it's like to send a receive messages with another person, have someone else create a new account and start a conversation with you.

### Things I'd Like to Add/Update/Change
- I would like to add the functionality of listening for new messages on a chat that isn't open and show a notification to the user in the message thread list
