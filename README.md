# Caish Chat - A React Chat Web Application
![Caish Chat Logo](./src/assets/images/logo_white_in_letters.png)

This is a fully functional real-time chat web application. Real-time features include:
- Sending and receiving messages
- Viewing someone's online/offline status if a conversation has been started
- Seeing when the other person is typing
- Ability to change profile picture if not logged in via a provider

There is a limit of 10 total messages that can be sent by each person since this is a demo and not a production application.

## Demo
[https://caish-chat.netlify.app](https://caish-chat.netlify.app)

## Testing strategy
In order to fully try out the website, you'll need to create an account. You can search for "Test User" to test out sending messages in a conversation, but if you would like to see what it's like to send and receive messages with another person, have someone else create an account and start a conversation with you.

## Things I'd Like to Add/Update/Change
- Add the functionality of listening for new messages on a chat that isn't open and show a notification to the user in the message thread list
- Add the Search functionality in conversation list
- Update how the user's profile picture is updated so that the user's picture changes when a conversation is open
- Make the look and feel on mobile/iPad better
